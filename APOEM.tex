\begin{abstract}
I answer two questions: what are we doing when we do meta-analysis, and
what do meta-analytic estimates signify? I first define two models of
meta-analysis that I find informative, which I call the ``all in'' and
``focused'' models depending on how comprehensively a paper searches for
and analyzes heterogeneous designs, interventions, and dependent
variables. I then summarize two recent critiques: the ``comprehensive''
critique from Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson (2022) -- that
meta-analyses which aim to assess all possible evidence are purposefully
eliding meaningful quality differences and therefore producing estimates
that are less informative than those we glean from a literature's best
papers -- and the ``coherence'' critique from Slough and Tyson (2023) --
that for meta-analytic estimates to mean anything at all, the assemebled
interventions need to be testing the same ideas and the assembled
dependent variables need to be measuring the true quantity of interest
in the same way. Next, I offer some possible defenses for the ``all in''
model of meta-analysis from these critiques revolving around careful,
humble interpretation of parameters. I conclude with some open questions
for meta-analysis stemming from the method's straddling the line between
deductive, hypothesis-driven and inductive, observation-driven modes of
inquiry, which makes, for example, hewing to a pre-analysis plan very
challenging.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{What are we doing when we do
meta-analyses?}\label{what-are-we-doing-when-we-do-meta-analyses}

What are meta-analyses for, and what does a ``meta-analytic estimate''
actually mean? I have now contributed to four meta-analyses, and I've
come to think that these questions are under-theorized by those of us
who try our hand at it. Part of the problem is that the surface purpose
and meaning of meta-analysis have a kind of pacifying effect to them:
amalgamating results from many studies produces unified estimates that
are more precise, and more externally valid, than any individual paper
could hope to produce. Empirical research is inevitably messy and noisy,
but a meta-analysis abstracts that all away and says: the answer, the
true population-level parameter, is d = (whatever).

There is an intuitive logic here. If a study with one set of
characteristics (e.g.~perfect randomization and a small sample size)
finds roughly the same effects as one with a totally different set
(e.g.~large samples and perfect treatment compliance but a dependent
variable with an unknown relationship to the true quantity of interest),
that lends credence to the idea that whatever effect you observe really
is the true parameter, and not an artifact of an idiosyncratic feature
of a particular study. If you \emph{do} find systematic differences in
your data, for instance, that one theoretical approach consistently
outperforms another or that treatment is most effective in some setting,
then that becomes your headline finding. If your evidence is strong
enough, you can declare the paper's central questions effectively
settled and point the next generation of researchers towards exploring
moderating conditions or theoretical extensions. You can wrap up a
meta-analysis and say: this territory is mapped. Onto the next question.

But lately I've begun to have doubts about this model of inquiry. They
began germinating while I was working on meta-analytic papers last year,
but really came to fruition when I read two recent, excellent, and
critical papers about meta-analysis: Slough and Tyson (2023) and
Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson (2022). Not every criticism registered,
but the two that did --- which I 'll call the ``comprehensive'' and
``coherence'' critiques --- get to the heart of the enterprise, and to
papers I've contributed to. They left me wondering if the meta-analytic
estimates I've produced are ``not even wrong'' (Scheel 2022) in the
sense of not being meaningful at all.

I think I've come up with reasonable and (I hope) novel responses to
these critiques. Thinking them through turned out to be a fine jumping
off point for articulating a ``personal epistemology'' of meta-analysis.
What I think I'm doing when I do meta-analysis. This paper is an attempt
to make something at least somewhat broadly applicable out of that.

In a nutshell, when I do meta-analysis, I am searching for the space
where a future experiment can be most useful, and in my experience, the
answer is often a well-designed study aimed at rigorously assessing a
subfield's most basic precepts.

\subsection{The two leading models of
meta-analysis}\label{the-two-leading-models-of-meta-analysis}

This aim yields papers that are, I believe, distinct from the two others
models of meta-analysis that I most frequently encounter. The first is
systematic reviews in biomedical fields (Kleinst√§uber et al. 1996;
Cumpston et al. 2019), which seem aimed mainly at telling medical
doctors, publich health officials, and/or policymakers wheteher some
procedure or intervention is worth doing. Another crucial difference is
that such reviews are often situated as the final word on a
subject,\footnote{For example, after two Cochrane reviews on the
  anti-malarial effects of insecticide-treated bed nets (Gamble, Ekwaru,
  and Kuile 2006; Lengeler 2004), the lead author of one review
  (Lengeler) told the charity evaluator GiveWell that ``there have been
  no more RCTs with treated nets. There is a very strong consensus that
  it would not be ethical to do any more. I don't think any committee in
  the world would grant permission to do such a trial'' (GiveWell 2018).
  Ultimately, there were three additional trials and an additional
  COCHRANE review (Pryce, Richardson, and Lengeler 2018).} whereas I aim
for my meta-analyses to just be one part of an evolving conversation,
especially in light of concerns about `temporal validity,' the idea that
effects might attenuate or evolve as conditions evolve (Munger 2023).

The second leading approach to meta-analysis is the model we observe in
social psychology. At the risk of painting with too broad a brush, that
genre of meta-analysis often has a valedictory, validating quality to
it. Such papers are often written by a subfield's leading practitioners
and function as a survey of existing work with intent to declare a
subfield's central questions answered (Pettigrew and Tropp 2006;
Bezrukova et al. 2016). My meta-analyses, by contrast, start from the
premises that most if not all basic questions in the behavioral sciences
are unanswered and that most research findings are false (Ioannidis
2005). However, I also believe that the emerging field of meta-science
(Ioannidis et al. 2015) and the methods of the credibility revolution
(Angrist and Pischke 2010; Vazire 2018) have given us a much better
sense of what results are most likely to be unbiased estimates, and
therefore to replicate successfully. Therefore, I write meta-analyses
with an eye towards unearthing, and sharing with readers, the sorts of
differences in study quality that illuminate which received
understandings are most in need of updating, and which designs are most
worth emulating and extending. Some of these tests exist within the
formal framework of meta-analysis and some are supplementary, but in
both cases, I hope to show how meta-analysis can become more
meta-scientific: quality-attendant, skeptical but open-minded, curious
and open-ended yet rigorous.

\subsubsection{Who is this paper aimed
at?}\label{who-is-this-paper-aimed-at}

This piece has three audiences in mind. The first and narrowest is `the
five critics,' the teams behind the two papers that sparked this one.
Slough, Tyson, Simmons, Simonsohn and Nelson have written deep,
trenchant meditations on meta-analysis and I think it behooves those of
us who actually do meta-analysis to respond.

The second is graduate students and early career researchers in labs who
do meta-analyses, I hope this piece proves stimulating, and perhaps a
departure point for articulating the epistemology underpinning your
work.

The third is researchers in fields where meta-analyses are uncommon but
who are nonetheless ``meta-curious,'' particularly folks who swim in the
currents of the credibility revolution. If you're in this group (which
might be a null set!), my hope is to persuade you that meta-analyses can
be worth reading and sometimes even worth writing, especially before (or
in parallel to) a new experiment.

\subsection{The remainder of this
paper}\label{the-remainder-of-this-paper}

The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. I will first articulate two
basic models of meta-analysis, each of which I think is capable of
producing interesting and useful papers: the ``all in'' approach, which
seeks to distill the lessons of (more or less) an entire literature, and
the ``focused'' approach, which subsets the literature substantially,
typically on some set of criteria related to design and/or measurement
strategy. I have written both types of paper, and though I prefer to
work on the second for its tractability, both have value.

Second, I will summarize the ``comprehensive'' critique from Simonsohn,
Simmons, and Nelson (2022) and the ``coherence'' critique from Slough
and Tyson (2023), both of which, as we will see, call the validity of
the all in approach into question much more than they do the focused
approach.

One potential response, of course, is to ignore these criticisms.
Another is to only do focused meta-analyses. The third is to offer
re-interpretations and procedural modifications to the all in approach
that render its estimates sensible and legible. I attempt to do this in
the next section.

Fourth, I conclude with meditations on unanswered questions for the
models of meta-analysis that I favor, stemming from their straddling the
line between deductive, hypothesis-driven and inductive,
observation-driven modes of inquiry. This makes, for example, hewing
closely to a pre-analysis plan challenging and potentially
counter-productive. Moreover, in my experience, null and/or
contradictory findings do not necessarily face adverse selection in the
publication process (though they may find some journals more amenable
than others).

We turn now to an overview of two promising models of meta-analysis.

\section{The all in and focused approaches to
meta-analysis}\label{the-all-in-and-focused-approaches-to-meta-analysis}

\subsection{All in, comprehensive assessment
out}\label{all-in-comprehensive-assessment-out}

\section{The comprehensive and coherence
critiques}\label{the-comprehensive-and-coherence-critiques}

\subsection{Comprehensive critique}\label{comprehensive-critique}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson (2022), argue that while the typical
  meta-analysis in social psychology aims ``to be comprehensive,
  results-focused and transcriptive,'' this is ``misguided, leading to
  uninterpretable results that misrepresent research literatures.''

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    a desire for comprehensiveness typically leads the meta- analyst to
    average ``studies of the highest quality'' with ``studies that lack
    internal validity or external validity, which are obtained using
    incorrect statistical techniques, or studies where results seem to
    arise from methodological artefacts.''

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      This throw-it-all-in-the-blender approach produces results that
      are ``virtually guaranteed to lack a meaningful interpretation''
      (p.~552) despite their superficial statistical precision.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Second, the authors encourage meta-analysts to focus on studies'
    designs, rather than just their results, to provide ``readers with
    information that they can use to evaluate'' (p.~552) the quality of
    a research literature for themselves.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Rather than describing every study, meta-analysts ``can succinctly
      describe and summarize common design failures\ldots and provide
      detailed descriptions only of the studies they deem most important
      or compelling'' (p.~552)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Evaluate rather than transcribe, i.e., detail the evidence from the
    very best studies, identify common methodological shortcomings of
    the literature as a whole, and, finally, ``discuss what open
    questions remain and what kinds of evidence would help answer those
    questions'' (p.~552).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson (2022) argue that researchers who
  ``uncritically'' aggregate results from all available studies, as part
  of an ``active effort to eliminate publication bias\ldots might
  instead amplify the bias from poor research design and execution''
  (p.~XXX).
\item
  We agree with this assessment, but would instead frame it as one of
  three crucial bias-variance trade-offs facing meta-analysts. By
  combining studies with non-comparable designs, interventions, and
  outcomes, researchers give readers the impression of remarkable
  precision (re: reduced variance) but at the expense of introducing
  non-statistical sources of uncertainty (re: bias) on all three fronts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coherence critique}\label{coherence-critique}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Slough and Tyson (2023) ``highlight the dangers of conflating
  conceptual differences across studies with statistical sources of
  variation'' (p.~29). They argue that for studies to have target
  equivalence (the property of identifying ``the same estimand''
  (p.~1)), they must have fundamentally \emph{harmonized} contrasts and
  measurement strategies: the ``substantive comparison across studies is
  the same'' and ``the outcome of interest is the same and it is
  measured in the same way'' (p.~2).
\item
  Absent these conditions, meta-analytic results might not be
  ``meaningful and interpretable'' (p.~2). Further, target equivalence
  cannot be achieved ``solely with statistical techniques'' (p.~23); it
  is a property, rather, of appropriate ``design or inclusion criteria''
  (p.~2).
\end{itemize}

approach}\label{defending-the-all-in-approach}

\subsection{But why bother? Reasons to write all in
papers}\label{but-why-bother-reasons-to-write-all-in-papers}

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  many open questions remain.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    lack of clarity about whether meta-analyses are, or should be,
    hypothesis-driven.
  \item
    Typical checks on researcher degrees of freedom (Gelman and Loken
    2013; Simonsohn, Nelson, and Simmons 2014) assume a
    hypothesis-driven framework, and indeed, meta-analyses in the social
    sciences are usually aimed at validating pre-existing hypotheses.
  \item
    Ours, however, are more exploratory: we aim for evaluation rather
    than validation. While we might start with some general hypotheses,
    these might be about a discipline rather than a literature. For
    example, our prior is that a social psychology literature from the
    2000s is likely to show evidence of selection pressures for
    statistical significance. However, we also develop many of our most
    important questions after reading papers, which, in the context of
    writing a meta-analysis, means after data collection has begun. In
    other words, our meta-analyses are both inductive and deductive
    inquiries. We are left with a conundrum: we wish to ``tie our hands
    to the mast'' (Elster 1977), e.g.~by writing detailed pre-analysis
    plans and sticking to them, while also acknowledging that the most
    incisive questions often emerge after reading and coding studies,
    i.e.~after data collection has begun.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Further, meta-analyses that are written before data collection are at
  risk of going off track by proceeding from false premises. Consider a
  mistake we made while composing the pre-analysis plan for Porat et al.
  (2024). Because we are accustomed to social psychology literatures, we
  registered the analysis that we would evaluate ``the overall effect
  size of behavioral outcomes for all of the studies in the dataset,
  both in the short- and in the long-term.'' The idea was to measure if
  effects of interventions attenuate over time, which is a serious
  concern in psychology. However, while some behavioral outcomes in the
  sexual violence literature are measured immediately (e.g.~whether
  someone volunteers for a campus rape education organization (Gillies
  1997)), most behavioral outcomes need time to accumulate. The Sexual
  Experiences Survey (SES) measures incidents of sexual violence in a
  given time period, and an SES administered at the end of a semester is
  essentially guaranteed to have more incidents than one given
  immediately after an intervention concludes. This only became clear to
  us after we began reading papers (though someone with better foresight
  could have anticipated the issue).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The way we resolved this was to make sure that we included, either
    in the paper or in an appendix, every single pre-registered
    analysis, even when they were not especially informative, and to
    explain the above issue in our appendix. Moving forward, we aim to
    have pre-specified analysis code run on simulated data (Broockman
    and Kalla 2016; Blair et al. 2019) and to devote more time to
    anticipating such issues.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Second, we sometimes encounter indirect signals of study quality in
  the literature that are difficult to integrate into formal inclusion
  and exclusion criteria. Should we exclude a study because it has an
  implausibly \emph{large} effect size, e.g.~a t-test value of 36? (One
  study in the prejudice reduction literature did.) What about errors in
  the text, or obvious discrepancies between results reported in the
  text and those in a table? What about a lack of transparent reporting
  that leads to our spending substantial time guessing a study's true
  effects? Each of these is information about a study's true quality; as
  Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson (2022) argue, excluding these studies
  would be the same ``kind of meritocratic screening of research'' that
  we ``engage in when performing virtually every other task in {[}our{]}
  professional research lives.''
\item
  Conversely, we might notice that a paper pays special attention to
  computational reproducibility, or was published in a journal where
  reproducibility checks are part of the publication process (Lowe
  2021); this is also a signal of study quality in the opposite
  direction. Some of these data points are easy to code, e.g.~data
  availability, and can be included in our meta-analyses; but some are
  not, e.g.~a the sensibility of a paper's statistical approaches.
\item
  There are clearly no easy answers to this problem, and different lab
  groups should come up with their own SOPs.\footnote{Over the course of
    many papers with Betsy Levy Paluck and co-authors, we've come up
    with the following:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      cluster RCTs with fewer than 10 clusters in total are so
      underpowered that they are effectively quasi-experiments, and we
      coded them as such in Porat et al. (2024).
    \item
      we do not code studies where we need to eyeball a figure to assess
      effect sizes: researchers should not make us guess.
    \item
      we do not convert ``the results were significant'' or simply ``p
      \textless{} .05'' into quantitative estimates. However, if authors
      tell us that a result was ``null'' or ``not significant'' but say
      anything more, we set the result to be 0.01.
    \end{itemize}

    These rules are not perfect, but ultimately, we need policies that
    balance type I errors (including studies we should exclude) and type
    II errors (excluding studies we should include). Like research
    itself, we suspect that this task is not perfectible.}
\item
  Last, there is a great deal of subjectivity in figuring out what
  outcomes to code. For Porat et al. (2024), we found relative
  homogeneity of dependent variables, but not so for Paluck, Green, and
  Green (2019) or Paluck et al. (2021). In the end,this has always been
  a judgment call, but as we continue writing meta-analyses, we hope to
  develop principled, general guidelines for this kind of analytic
  choice.
\item
  These open questions notwithstanding, we think meta-analyses can be
  useful, informative, and a pleasure to write and read. We hope to see
  them become a standard part of the meta-scientist's toolkit, and
  likewise for all meta-analyses to become more meta-scientific.
